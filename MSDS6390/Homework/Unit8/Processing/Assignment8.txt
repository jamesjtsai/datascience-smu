Using an OOP approach and any Processing features covered thus far throughout the course, create a related series of three to five visualizations based on an issue of your choice. Each visualization should be distinct but based on the same data source. In addition, incorporate some interactivity in your solution(s). Please be prepared to discuss the challenge of building a more complex program and the benefit of creating multiple visualizations based on a common data source. Also please discuss next steps you would ideally like to take with the project.

Please upload a zip archive of your project by clicking the Submissions tab above.
