#### Quantifying the World
In the global information age, data can be leveraged to rapidly answer previously unanswerable questions. Students explore how to make sense of the large amounts of data frequently available, from hypothesis formation and data collection to methods of analysis and visualization. Includes ways to set up Internet-level measurements and formulate testable hypotheses; ways to automatically gather, store, and query large datasets; and ways to apply statistical methods (descriptive and predictive) and information visualization to collected datasets. Students learn to use Python and R programming languages to carry out data collection, analysis, and visualization. Culminates in a final project using real data of the student's choosing.
